<p>Here is a timeline of Margaret Hamilton's life and accomplishments:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>August 17, 1936 - </b>Born in Paoli, Indiana to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield.</li>
  <li><b>1954 through 1958 - </b>After graduatating Hancock High School, she enrolled at University of Michigan as a math major, transferred to Earlham College and graduated with a BA in philosophy and mathematics in 1958.</li>
  <li><b>Autumn 1958 - </b>Started graduate program in abstract mathematics at Brandeis.</li>
  <li><b>1960 - </b>took interim position at MIT to develop software for predicting weather on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers (at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC) for professor Edward Norton Lorenz in the meteorology department. Computer science an programming were nascent fields.</li>
  <li><b>1961 through 1963 - </b>SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) Project at Lincoln Lab, the first U.S air defense program. She wrote software for the first AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1) to search for unfriendly aircraft; she also wrote software for the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.</li>
  <li><b>1964 - </b>joined the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT, which at the time was working on the Apollo space mission. She eventually led a team credited with developing the software for Apollo and Skylab.</li>
  <li><b>1976 through 1984 - </b>Hamilton was the CEO of a company she co-founded called Higher Order Software (HOS) to further develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from her experience at MIT.</li> 
  <li>Coined the term <em>software engineering</em> to raise the status of software development on par with that of other engineering disciplines and to distinguish it from other kinds of engineering.
</ul>
